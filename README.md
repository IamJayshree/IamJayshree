## Hi 🤍☁️

I am Jayshree. [`blog ~`](https://medium.com/@jayshreea222)

I am a fullstack developer with around 3 years of professional experience in tech, working and building scalable platforms. 
I’ve worked with companies like Amazon and MAQ Software.

Although I am a full-stack developer, 
I specialize in back-end development and DevOps, 
focusing on building and deploying applications that handle high amounts of traffic.

I am tech-agnostic and I enjoy learning new things.
Preferred stack: Django, Python, AWS, web-dev (React, Typescript, TailwindCSS, Node.js, Express, Firebase).

I enjoy learning and exploring new things, especially those where I get to learn unique perspectives and experiences.
These days, I am living in Hyderabad. 🌆✨

## ✮ services

As a freelance developer, I have been building custom web applications.
- I develop responsive one-page web apps and landing pages using React.
- I build robust backends with Django and Django REST Framework.
- I also assist clients with buying domains and setting up hosting.
- I offer full-stack solutions, handling both frontend and backend development.
- I ensure high performance and scalability in all my projects.

If you want my help in your projects please email me at jayshreework1@gmail.com. 

## ✮ hobbies (apart from tech)
I loved reading and writing since I learned to. As a kid, I used to read storybooks a lot, often finishing them in 30 minutes to an hour. I also wrote a lot, mostly my thoughts or about my day. It's still fun to read those things. I've always loved drawing and painting as well, and I enjoy trying creative things. I have some experience in making videos and editing them. I love walking in nature, and on some weekends when I’m free, I enjoy spending my mornings trying different cafes with beautiful coffee.
